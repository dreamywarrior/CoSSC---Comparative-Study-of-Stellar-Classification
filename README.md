# CoSSC---Comparative-Study-of-Stellar-Classification

* Realizing the need of the hour about bringing in an efficient method of cataloging, our team has produced an updated version of classifying stars, galaxies and quasars using precise accumulated inputs. With an aim of aiding humanitarian advancement, the projectâ€™s foresight is to implement the program as a staple in research space stations. 
* The predetermined result assists in the process of selecting the appropriate algorithm, thus reducing the time consumption of a complex process. 
* Machine Learning as a branch has provided incentives for the interpretation of Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR-16 & DR-17 datasets, which we will be incorporating into the process of classifying stars, quasars, and galaxies. 
* While the project remains an extension of the works of previous researchers, we have brought forward our perspective to testify the accuracy of results derived from the data. 
* By the means of implementation of five self-sufficient algorithms involved in Machine Learning, the research will be a comparative study between the accuracies provided by the selected algorithms with the datasets provided as inputs individually. 
* The inferences will further be extended to highlight the trends which have changed in the interval of data update, and finally, the best suited algorithm, in terms of accuracy, will be chosen for the DR-17 dataset.
* Our contribution to the works of the past researchers has brought out the optimal ML model to fit the data provided by the DR-17 dataset and classifies them accordingly into stars, quasars, and galaxies.
